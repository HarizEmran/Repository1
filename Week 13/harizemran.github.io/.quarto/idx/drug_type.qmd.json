For instance, some drug types could be significant yet not reflected here due to more covert operations that have thus far managed to escape surveillance and enforcement. However, due to the lack of such data, the current statistics available on drug types seized remain the most reliable form of data for analysis of their popularity.\n\nOverall, there have been differing trends for different types of drugs from 2003 to 2021. Some have boomed in popularity, some have grown out of significance, others have remained stagnantly present. It is crucial to study the local trends surrounding these particular drugs, and their correlations with global drug trends, to be able to design more targeted and effective solutions such as in the form of aftercare programmes for abusers as well as enforcement strategies to root out and seize drug hotspots.\n\nDrugs that have ostensibly been increasing in popularity include *Cannabis*, *Heroin*, *Ice* and *New Psychoactive Substances (NPS)*.\n\nMeanwhile, drugs that seem to have been losing or lost popularity include *Heroin No.4*, *Opium*, *Buprenorphine*, *Erimin 5* and *Yaba*.\n\nDrugs that have largely stagnated while persisting are *Ketamine* and *Ecstasy*.\n\nBased on these deductions, the CNB could direct their strategies and resources to focus more on drugs that have been increasing in popularity as well as those that have persisted despite stagnating. While data on tendency of abuse of certain types of drugs amongst different age groups is not publicly available at the moment, the CNB could derive certain patterns from their own records to better inform its strategies of [*Preventive Drug Education (PDE)*](index.qmd) and [*Structured Rehabilitation & Aftercare Programmes*](index.qmd).\n\nFor instance, since *Ketamine* is recognised as being common at dance parties^2^, the CNB could channel their efforts into surveillance and enforcement at places like night clubs and dance party events to seize potential drug abusers and suppliers. The rising trend of *Cannabis* seems to also be in line with greater attention on the substances and shifting attitudes towards it given its increasing legalisation around the world^4^. It is also popular as a first drug in Singapore, according to a survey conducted by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH)^5^.
