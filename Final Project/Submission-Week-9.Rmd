# Week-9: Webpage + Diary Entry

## What is the topic that you have finalised?

I have finalised on the topic of drug abuse and rehabilitation trends in Singapore over the years.

## What are the data sources that you have curated so far?

I have curated some data sets from <https://beta.data.gov.sg/>, Singapore's national open data collection site. The data sets that I have collated thus far are namely the demographics of inhalant abusers arrested and the inmates undergoing rehabilitation in the Drug Rehabilitation Centre as well as the quantity and type of controlled drugs that have been seized.
